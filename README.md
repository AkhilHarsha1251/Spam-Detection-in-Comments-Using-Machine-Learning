## Introduction

In the digital age, online platforms have become prime venues for interaction and information exchange. However, with the rise of these platforms comes the challenge of managing spam comments. These spam comments can be detrimental as they clutter discussions, mislead users, and sometimes carry malicious content. Identifying and filtering out spam manually is impractical due to the sheer volume of comments generated daily.

Machine Learning (ML) offers a robust solution to this problem. By training ML models on datasets of labeled comments, we can automate the detection and filtering of spam. This project aims to build an ML-based spam detection system that can effectively distinguish between spam and non-spam comments, enhancing the user experience and maintaining the quality of online interactions.



## Dataset

The dataset used for this project should contain labeled comments, indicating whether each comment is spam or not. The Data Set which I used was [this](https://www.kaggle.com/prashant111/youtube-spam-collection). You can use a public dataset or create your own by labeling a set of comments manually.

## Usage

To get started with this project, download the repository files which i have provided and run the youtube_spam_filter_using_naive_bayes.ipynb:

and then add the comment which you have to check whether it's a spam or not
