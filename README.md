## Introduction

Spam comments are a pervasive problem on many online platforms. They disrupt meaningful conversations and can often contain malicious content. By leveraging machine learning, we can build a system to automatically detect and filter out spam comments.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project should contain labeled comments, indicating whether each comment is spam or not. The Data Set which I used was [this](https://www.kaggle.com/prashant111/youtube-spam-collection). You can use a public dataset or create your own by labeling a set of comments manually.

## Usage

To get started with this project, download the repository files which i have provided and run the youtube_spam_filter_using_naive_bayes.ipynb:

and then add the comment which you have to check whether it's a spam or not
