## Introduction

Spam comments are a pervasive problem on many online platforms. They disrupt meaningful conversations and can often contain malicious content. By leveraging machine learning, we can build a system to automatically detect and filter out spam comments.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project should contain labeled comments, indicating whether each comment is spam or not. The Data Set which I used was [this]. You can use a public dataset or create your own by labeling a set of comments manually.

## Installation

To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/spam-detection-ml.git
